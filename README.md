# Contract Testing Learning Hour 1

## Consumer Driven Contract Testing

This workshop is aimed at deliberately practicing producing a consumer driven contract using Pact.

Whilst contract testing can be applied retrospectively to already existing systems 
(you may want to consider bi-directional contract testing for those use cases), we will follow the 
[consumer driven contracts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html) approach in this kata - where a new consumer "goes first" producing 
a contract that the provider will use to TDD the endpoints in their service in parallel.  
Both parties can then be sure that they have built exactly what each other was expecting 
making integration or e2e testing between the real services a formality.

This workshop should take from 1 to 2 hours, depending on how deep you want to go into each topic.

**Workshop outline**:

- [step 1: **Define the expectation of the provider**](https://github.com/jjwils/cdc-lh1-kata/tree/step1#step-1---simple-consumer-calling-provider): Define the provider API in a test in our Consumer codebase.
- [step 2: **unit test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step2#step-2---client-tested-but-integration-fails): Write a unit test for our consumer
- [step 3: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step3#step-3---pact-to-the-rescue): Write a Pact test for our consumer
- [step 4: **pact verification**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step4#step-4---verify-the-provider): Verify the consumer pact with the Provider API
- [step 5: **fix consumer**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step5#step-5---back-to-the-client-we-go): Fix the consumer's bad assumptions about the Provider
- [step 6: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step6#step-6---consumer-updates-contract-for-missing-products): Write a pact test for `404` (missing User) in consumer
- [step 7: **provider states**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step7#step-7---adding-the-missing-states): Update API to handle `404` case
- [step 8: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step8#step-8---authorization): Write a pact test for the `401` case
- [step 9: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step9#step-9---implement-authorisation-on-the-provider): Update API to handle `401` case
- [step 10: **request filters**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step10#step-10---request-filters-on-the-provider): Fix the provider to support the `401` case
- [step 11: **pact broker**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step11#step-11---using-a-pact-broker): Implement a broker workflow for integration with CI/CD

_NOTE: Each step is tied to, and must be run within, a git branch, allowing you to progress through each stage incrementally. For example, to move to step 2 run the following: `git checkout step2`_

## Learning objectives

If running this as a team workshop format, you may want to take a look through the [learning objectives](./LEARNING.md).

## Requirements

- JDK 17+
- Maven 3+

## Scenario

There are two components in scope for our workshop.

1. Product Catalog website. It provides an interface to query the Product service for product information.
1. Product Service (Provider). Provides useful things about products, such as listing all products and getting the details of an individual product.

## Step 1 - Define the expectation of the provider

*Provider states* is an important concept of Pact that we need to introduce. These states define the state that the provider should be in for specific interactions. For the moment, we will initially be testing the following state that 
is defined in the ```.given("a job exists")``` on line 4 below.
You can think of this as the *Given* step in *Given, When, Then* and is where *us the consumer* are designing the API of the provider *before it even exists*.

Your task is to fill out the TODO's below to create the API we want from the provider to meet Samir's expected response.

*Hint* - have a look at the traditional integration test in the JobServiceClientTest class.


```java
@Pact(consumer = "SamirsApp")
public RequestResponsePact getJob(PactDslWithProvider builder) {
return builder
.given("a job exists")
.uponReceiving("get job")
.path("TODO")
.willRespondWith()
.status(-1)//CHANGE THIS TO THE INT FOR HTTP.OK
.body(
new PactDslJsonBody()
.object("TODO", new PactDslJsonBody()
.stringType("TODO", "TODO")
.stringType("TODO", "TODO")
.stringType("TODO", "TODO")
)
.stringType("TODO", "TODO")
.stringType("TODO", "TODO")
.stringType("TODO", "TODO")
.stringType("TODO", "TODO")
.booleanType("TODO", false)
)
.toPact();
}
```





We need to first create an HTTP client to make the calls to our provider service:

![Simple Consumer](diagrams/workshop_step1.svg)

The Consumer has implemented the product service client which has the following:

- `GET /products` - Retrieve all products
- `GET /products/{id}` - Retrieve a single product by ID

The diagram below highlights the interaction for retrieving a product with ID 10:

![Sequence Diagram](diagrams/workshop_step1_class-sequence-diagram.svg)

You can see the service client interface we created in `consumer/src/main/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClient.java`:

```java
@Service
public class ProductServiceClient {
  @Autowired
  private RestTemplate restTemplate;

  @Value("${serviceClients.products.baseUrl}")
  private String baseUrl;

  public ProductServiceResponse fetchProducts() {
    return restTemplate.getForObject(baseUrl + "/products", ProductServiceResponse.class);
  }

  public Product fetchProductById(long id) {
    return restTemplate.getForObject(baseUrl + "/products/" + id, Product.class);
  }
}
```

After forking or cloning the repository, we need to build the app and install the dependencies. Run the following
in the `consumer` sub-directory:

```console
consumer ❯ ./mvnw verify
```

We can run the app with 

```console
consumer ❯ java -jar target/product-catalogue-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Accessing the URL for the app in the browser gives us a 500 error page as the downstream service is not running. 
You will also see an exception in the Springboot console output.

```
 I/O error on GET request for "http://localhost:9000/products": Connection refused
```

*Move on to [step 2](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step2#step-2---client-tested-but-integration-fails)*

## Step 2 - Client Tested but integration fails

Now let's create a basic test for our API client. We're going to check 2 things:

1. That our client code hits the expected endpoint
1. That the response is marshalled into an object that is usable, with the correct ID

You can see the client interface test we created in `consumer/src/test/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClientTest.java`:

```java
  @Test
  void getProductById(@Wiremock WireMockServer server, @WiremockUri String uri) {
      productServiceClient.setBaseUrl(uri);
      server.stubFor(
          get(urlPathEqualTo("/products/10"))
              .willReturn(aResponse()
              .withStatus(200)
              .withBody("{\n" +
                  "            \"id\": 50,\n" +
                  "            \"type\": \"CREDIT_CARD\",\n" +
                  "            \"name\": \"28 Degrees\",\n" +
                  "            \"version\": \"v1\"\n" +
                  "        }\n")
              .withHeader("Content-Type", "application/json"))
      );
    
      Product product = productServiceClient.getProductById(10);
      assertThat(product, is(equalTo(new Product(10L, "28 Degrees", "CREDIT_CARD", "v1", null))));

  }
```

If you encounter failing tests after running `./mvnw verify`, make sure that the current branch is `step2`.

Meanwhile, our provider team has started building out their API in parallel. Let's run our website against our provider (you'll need two terminals to do this):

```

You should now see a screen showing 3 different products. There is a `Details ...` link which should display detailed product information.

Let's see what happens!

![Failed page](diagrams/workshop_step2_failed_page.png)

Doh! We are getting 500 everytime we try to view detailed product information. On closer inspection, 
we can see a 404 from the Product Service in the logs.

```
HttpClientErrorException$NotFound: 404 : [{"timestamp":"2021-02-25T05:27:51.264+00:00","status":404,"error":"Not Found","message":"","path":"/products/9"}]]
```

The issue is that the provider only knows about `/product/{id}` and `/products`.

We need to have a conversation about what the endpoint should be, but first...

*Move on to [step 3](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step3#step-3---pact-to-the-rescue)*

## Step 3 - Pact to the rescue

Unit tests are written and executed in isolation of any other services. When we write tests for code that talk to
other services, they are built on trust that the contracts are upheld. There is no way to validate that the 
consumer and provider can communicate correctly.

> An integration contract test is a test at the boundary of an external service verifying that it meets the 
> contract expected by a consuming service — [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationContractTest.html)

Adding contract tests via Pact would have highlighted the `/product/{id}` endpoint was incorrect.

Let us add Pact to the project and write a consumer pact test for the `GET /products/{id}` endpoint.

*Provider states* is an important concept of Pact that we need to introduce. These states help define the state that the provider should be in for specific interactions. For the moment, we will initially be testing the following states:

- `product with ID 10 exists`
- `products exist`

The consumer can define the state of an interaction using the `given` property.

Pact test `consumer/src/test/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClientPactTest.java`:

```java
@SpringBootTest
@ExtendWith(PactConsumerTestExt.class)
@PactTestFor(providerName = "ProductService")
class ProductServiceClientPactTest {
  @Autowired
  private ProductServiceClient productServiceClient;

  @Pact(consumer = "ProductCatalogue")
  public RequestResponsePact allProducts(PactDslWithProvider builder) {
    return builder
      .given("products exists")
        .uponReceiving("get all products")
        .path("/products")
      .willRespondWith()
        .status(200)
        .body(
          new PactDslJsonBody()
            .minArrayLike("products", 1, 2)
              .integerType("id", 9L)
              .stringType("name", "Gem Visa")
              .stringType("type", "CREDIT_CARD")
              .closeObject()
            .closeArray()
        )
      .toPact();
  }

  @Test
  @PactTestFor(pactMethod = "allProducts", pactVersion = PactSpecVersion.V3)
  void testAllProducts(MockServer mockServer) {
    productServiceClient.setBaseUrl(mockServer.getUrl());
    List<Product> products = productServiceClient.fetchProducts().getProducts();
    assertThat(products, hasSize(2));
    assertThat(products.get(0), is(equalTo(new Product(9L, "Gem Visa", "CREDIT_CARD", null, null))));
  }

  @Pact(consumer = "ProductCatalogue")
  public RequestResponsePact singleProduct(PactDslWithProvider builder) {
    return builder
      .given("product with ID 10 exists", "id", 10)
      .uponReceiving("get product with ID 10")
        .path("/products/10")
      .willRespondWith()
        .status(200)
        .body(

![Test using Pact](diagrams/workshop_step3_pact.svg)

These tests starts a mock server on a random port that acts as our provider service. To get this to work we update the 
URL in the `ProductServiceClient` to point to the mock server that Pact provides for the test.

Running this test also passes, but it creates a pact file which we can use to validate our assumptions on the 
provider side, and have conversation around.

A pact file should have been generated in *consumer/target/pacts/ProductCatalogue-ProductService.json*

*NOTE*: even if the API client had been graciously provided for us by our Provider Team, it doesn't mean that we 
shouldn't write contract tests - because the version of the client we have may not always be in sync with the 
deployed API - and also because we will write tests on the output appropriate to our specific needs.

*Move on to [step 4](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step4#step-4---verify-the-provider)*
